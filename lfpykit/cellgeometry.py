class CellGeometry(object):
    '''
    Base class representing the geometry of multicompartment neuron
    models.

    Assumptions
        - each compartment is piecewise linear between their start
          and endpoints
        - each compartment has a constant diameter
        - the transmembrane current density is constant along the
          compartment axis

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: ndarray of floats
        shape (n_seg x 2) array of start- and end-point coordinates of
        each compartment along x-axis in units of (µm)
    y: ndarray
        shape (n_seg x 2) array of start- and end-point coordinates of
        each compartment along y-axis in units of (µm)
    z: ndarray
        shape (n_seg x 2) array of start- and end-point coordinates of
        each compartment along z-axis in units of (µm)
    d: ndarray
        shape (n_seg) or shape (n_seg x 2) array of compartment
        diameters in units of (µm). If the 2nd axis is equal to 2,
        conical frusta is assumed.

    Attributes
    ----------
    totnsegs: int
        number of compartments
    x: ndarray of floats
        shape (totnsegs x 2) array of start- and end-point coordinates of
        each compartment along x-axis in units of (µm)
    y: ndarray
        shape (totnsegs x 2) array of start- and end-point coordinates of
        each compartment along y-axis in units of (µm)
    z: ndarray
        shape (totnsegs x 2) array of start- and end-point coordinates of
        each compartment along z-axis in units of (µm)
    d: ndarray
        shape (totnsegs) array of compartment diameters in units of (µm)
    length: ndarray
        lenght of each compartment in units of um
    area: ndarray
        array of compartment surface areas in units of um^2
