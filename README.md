lfpy_forward_models
===================

This Python module will contain freestanding implementations of electrostatic
forward models presently incorporated in LFPy
(https://github.com/LFPy/LFPy, https://LFPy.readthedocs.io).

The aim is to provide electrostatic models in a manner that facilitates
forward-model predictions of extracellular potentials and related measures from
multicompartment neuron models, but without explicit dependencies on neural
simulation software such as NEURON
(https://neuron.yale.edu, https://github.com/neuronsimulator/nrn).
